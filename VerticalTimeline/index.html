        <h3> Wibbly-Wobbly </h3>
        <p> Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word: that's why I like it! Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim. But I'll tell you what it does do: it is very good at opening doors! There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a
          race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky. People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually, from
          a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff. </p>

        <h3> Timey - Wimey </h3>
        <p> New-new-Doctor. I'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable! Yeah? Well I'm the Lord of Time. You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I
          have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords. Goodbye...my Sarah Jane! I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you? Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you,
          Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger. </p>

        <h3>Allons-y</h3>
        <p> Itâ€™s a bit more exciting when you go the other way. Well, you're very similar heights. Maybe you should wear labels. It's all right up to the eyebrows. Then it goes haywire. So you've got a room for not being awake in. What's the point? You're
          just missing the room! Be a pal and tell me, Am I a good man? You see when I started, all those years ago, I was just running. I called myself the Doctor but it was just a name. Then I went to Skaro. And I met you lot. And I understood who I
          was. When this is all over, you can find a shoulder to cry on. But for now, you need me. </p>
